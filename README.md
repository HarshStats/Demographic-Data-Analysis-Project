# Demographic Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the analysis and visualization of global demographic trends, focusing on life expectancy and under-five mortality rates across 227 countries. The project is part of the Introductory Case Studies course at TU Dortmund.

## Project Overview

The project aims to explore demographic changes over a 20-year period (2004-2024), utilizing data from the **International Database (IDB, 2024)** provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. Key objectives include:

- **Descriptive Analysis**: Examining frequency distributions, central tendency, and variability of life expectancy and under-five mortality rates.
- **Regional Comparisons**: Analyzing homogeneity within subregions and variations between regions.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating relationships between life expectancy and mortality rates.
- **Temporal Trends**: Observing changes between 2004 and 2024.

## Statistical Methods

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Mean, median, variance, and five-number summary.
- **Visualization Techniques**: Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson correlation coefficients.

## Tools and Libraries

The analysis was conducted using Python 3.9, with the following libraries:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.

## Key Findings

1. **Life Expectancy**: A significant increase was observed globally, with females consistently living longer than males.
2. **Under-Five Mortality**: A noticeable decline, reflecting improvements in global healthcare.
3. **Correlation**: Strong negative correlation between life expectancy and under-five mortality rates.
